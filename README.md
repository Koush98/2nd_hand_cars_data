## Introduction

The Toyota Data EDA Project provides an in-depth analysis of Toyota car data. By performing EDA, we aim to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset. This project includes data cleaning, visualization, and correlation analysis to help understand the factors influencing car prices and other attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various Toyota car models. Key features include:

- **Model**: The model name of the car.
- **Price**: The price of the car.
- **Age**: The age of the car in years.
- **KM**: The mileage of the car in kilometers.
- **FuelType**: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Diesel, Petrol, CNG).
- **HP**: The horsepower of the car.
- **MetColor**: Indicates whether the car has metallic color.
- **Automatic**: Indicates whether the car has an automatic transmission.
- **CC**: The engine displacement in cubic centimeters.
- **Doors**: The number of doors in the car.
- **Weight**: The weight of the car in kilograms.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Correlation Analysis
- Insights and Findings

## Installation

To run the analyses and visualizations, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- google.colab (for Google Colab-specific functionalities, if needed)

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib google-colab
